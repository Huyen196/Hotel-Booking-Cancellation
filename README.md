In the past few years, both the City Hotel and Resort Hotel have experienced significant increases in their cancellation rates. As a result, both hotels are currently facing a range of challenges, such as reduced revenue and underutilized hotel rooms. Therefore, the top priority for both hotels is to reduce their cancellation rates, which will enhance their efficiency in generating revenue. 

This project aims to use the hotel dataset to identify the factors effect to guests decide cancel their booking and develop a predictive model to reduce this situation. A model figure out the factors which affect to the hotel’s booking cancellation, along with actionable insights to reduce cancelation rates.

With this data, it’s possible to support the hotels have a model to predict if a guest will actually come. This can help hotels to plan things like personel and food requirements. Moreover, they can figure out how to reduce the number of booking cancellation and increase their revenue.
